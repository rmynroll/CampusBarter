# 🎓 Campus Takas  
**Student-to-Student Sharing & Barter Platform**

---

## 📌 Overview

**Campus Takas** is a student-only digital platform that enables **free sharing**, **bartering**, and **student-friendly exchanges** within university campuses.  
Access is restricted to verified academic email addresses (.edu / .edu.tr) to ensure trust and safety.

Unlike traditional marketplaces, Campus Takas **does not prioritize profit**.  
Instead, it promotes **solidarity, sustainability, and peer-to-peer support** among students.
